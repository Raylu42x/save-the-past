  <h1>About Us</h1>

  <div class="intro">
    We are the Robo Cats, a homeschooled FIRST LEGO League team based in Duvall, Washington. 
    Most of us meet at our co-op, Labyrinth. Our team includes 10 members between the ages of 
    9 and 14. Together, we combine creativity, engineering, research, and teamwork to build 
    solutions that help preserve the past one disk at a time.
